// Two modes:
//   - 編組 (Group): a set of up to 5 teams sharing a hero/skill uniqueness
//     constraint — mirrors what the user actually owns in the live game.
//   - 精選隊伍 (FeaturedTeam — kept as `Proposal` in code/DB for backwards
//     compatibility): a single team frozen as a snapshot, optionally made
//     public for community sharing/voting/import. No uniqueness constraint
//     vs. anything else (theory-craft). The CHT label was originally
//     "配將提案" but that name is reserved for a future group-level
//     theory-craft suggestion feature.
//
// `Lineup` (= Team) lives in useLineups; we only re-export the alias here so
// upstream consumers can read intent without ambient cross-imports.
