Match-rate floor check: every kind in data/prototype/*_proto.yaml must
keep at least its baseline cfg-match coverage. Catches regressions where
a cfg refresh removed entries the build expects.

Run alone (`uv run script/check_cfg_drift.py`) or as part of
`check_data_integrity.py`.

# Regression floors (NOT target match rates). A drop below means a cfg refresh
# stopped recognising entries the build previously matched — investigate before
# loosening. Re-baseline upward as upstream coverage stabilises; never lower
# silently.
#
# Why each kind sits where it does:
#   skills   — game8 and cfg overlap is near-complete; drops here usually mean
#              a renamed cfg entry (add it to source_corrections.yaml).
#   heroes   — every crawled hero must resolve; failure is a regression.
#   traits   — game8 carries some traits cfg doesn't expose; 0.85 reflects
#              that structural gap, not a quality issue.
#   bingxue  — tight floor because the 天赋 set is small and stable.
#   assembly — 评定众 only matches via base name (after stripping 普/良/优
#              tiers); many crawled entries lack a ja↔hans bridge in cfg yet.
